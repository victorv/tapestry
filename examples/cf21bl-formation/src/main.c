/*
 * main.c — CF21BL collective formation demo (lighthouse + syslink P2P)
 *
 * Two build modes (Kconfig choice DEMO_MODE):
 *
 *   DEMO_MODE_CHOREO (default) — the L5/L6/L7 path.  ONE BINARY for all
 *     drones: element IDs are negotiated at boot (transport_negotiate_id,
 *     same auto-ID protocol as cutebot-formation).  A real L5 SCR (see
 *     scr_init()/scr_tick() below) drives quorum/role/task_slot/abort from
 *     the actual world model — no synthetic quorum.  A declarative L7
 *     Choreo script drives the flight through the L6 BSE:
 *       1. hold  — station-keep at the current position (coordinate-free)
 *       2. exchange — swap places: each drone takes its partner's station
 *          via the BSE's centroid-arc maneuver (snapshot targets, mutual
 *          separation preserved by construction), advancing on the L6
 *          achievement predicate
 *       3. hold (bow) — settle on the new stations so both drones finish
 *          their scripts while the collective is still fresh (achievement
 *          is per-element; without this beat the first finisher would land
 *          and suspend its partner mid-maneuver)
 *     Script completion → directive IDLE → quiescence: this platform maps
 *     it to landing in place and disarming.  The Choreo never says "take
 *     off" or "land" — those words don't exist at L7.
 *
 *   DEMO_MODE_SHOWCASE — the flight-validated 2026-07 spring-field
 *     showcase (L4 only, per-drone builds): line → rotating triangle →
 *     member departs → line re-forms.
 *
 * Both modes use REAL lighthouse position (not dead reckoning) for peer
 * gossip and the stabilizer's own X/Y position hold.  See formation.h for
 * the meters unit convention and the shared-calibration requirement.
 *
 * Architecture:
 *   Attitude:    BMI088 rate + angle loops (cf21bl_stabilizer.c, unchanged)
 *   Yaw heading: CONFIG_CF21BL_YAW_HOLD — locked to boot orientation so
 *                world-frame corrections stay meaningful (Mahony yaw is
 *                boot-relative with no absolute reference, hence the
 *                requirement: place each drone with its nose along lighthouse
 *                world +X at power-on).
 *   Altitude:    CONFIG_CF21BL_ALTITUDE_HOLD (baro, closed-loop) — tracks a
 *                rate-limited setpoint (ALT_BASE_M by default, or
 *                directive.target.z once Choreo is driving).
 *   X/Y:         CONFIG_CF21BL_LIGHTHOUSE_POS_HOLD (stabilizer-internal
 *                P+I+D loop) — this file only ever commands an ABSOLUTE
 *                world-frame target, converted to the stabilizer's
 *                home-relative normalized form via
 *                cf21bl_stabilizer_get_pos_home().
 *   Formation:   formation.c's holonomic spring field, computed from REAL
 *                gossiped peer positions (no odometry drift).
 *
 * Safety layer (see the flight_state_t machine below):
 *   - Own battery LOW (cf21bl_pm_battery_low(), DEMO_MODE_CHOREO only):
 *     this file preempts the running Choreo goal/script with a CONVERGE-
 *     to-home goal (choreo_preempt_goal()) — a graceful, L6/L7-mediated
 *     return-to-base rather than an abrupt stop, and the demo for the
 *     v1.0 goal-queue-with-preemption feature. The original goal/script
 *     resumes automatically if this drone somehow un-preempts (it
 *     doesn't in practice — see the call site) rather than being lost.
 *   - Own battery CRITICAL (cf21bl_pm_battery_critical(), a lower/later
 *     threshold than LOW): still handled independently inside
 *     cf21bl_stabilizer.c (CONFIG_CF21BL_PM forced-landing path) — no code
 *     needed here, and it does not depend on or affect other drones. This
 *     is the hard backstop if RTH above doesn't land in time.
 *   - Own lighthouse fix lost: this file must intervene, because the
 *     stabilizer reinterprets stale linear.x/y as velocity feedforward
 *     once POS_HOLD falls back — holding a position-style value through
 *     that transition would command a sustained runaway tilt.  Zero X/Y
 *     immediately on fix loss; land after FIX_LOSS_GRACE_MS sustained loss.
 *   - Geofence: own real position straying past GEOFENCE_RADIUS_M from the
 *     lighthouse origin triggers an individual landing.
 *   - Minimum separation: formation.c applies extra repulsion below
 *     DEMO_MIN_SEP_M; this file only logs a warning if it's violated
 *     anyway (formation.c reports the closest peer distance each tick).
 *   - Mission duration: every drone independently lands after
 *     MISSION_DURATION_S from its own arm time — the closest thing to a
 *     "coordinated" land command without a wireless uplink, since all
 *     drones arm within the same sync window (see DEMO_SYNC_GRACE_MS).
 *   All landing triggers are per-drone local state — one drone landing
 *   never affects another's flight.
 *
 * Placement requirement: place each drone in its own starting spot, nose
 * along lighthouse world +X, BEFORE arming — the stabilizer captures that
 * drone's OWN lighthouse-frame position as its "home" the instant this
 * file first commands a non-idle altitude (see cf21bl_stabilizer.c's
 * position-hold home capture).  Starting positions do not need to match
 * the final formation shape; the spring field converges regardless.
 *
 * Build (one per drone):
 *   west build -p always -b crazyflie21bl tapestry/examples/cf21bl-formation \
 *     -- -DCONFIG_TAPESTRY_ELEMENT_ID=0   # 1, 2 for other drones
 * Flash:
 *   cfloader flash build/zephyr/zephyr.bin stm32-dfu
 * Console:
 *   python3 tapestry/tapestry-os/tools/crazyflie_console.py   (CRTP radio — USART3 is taken
 *   by the lighthouse deck; see boards/crazyflie21bl.conf.  With 3 drones
 *   transmitting on the same nRF51 radio config, treat concurrent consoles
 *   as best-effort — see Phase D fleet bring-up notes.)
 *
 * Flight checklist:
 *   1. Flash all three drones with IDs 0, 1, 2 — SAME lighthouse BS pose
 *      and OOTX calibration constants below on all three (same YAML).
 *   2. Place each drone in the arena, nose along lighthouse world +X,
 *      spaced roughly DEMO_TARGET_SPACING_M apart — exact placement is not
 *      critical, the spring field will converge.
 *   3. Power on all three within the sync window (a few seconds of slack).
 *   4. Each drone: gyro cal, waits for its own lighthouse fix (abort/idle
 *      if none within 30 s), 5 s countdown, arms, gentle altitude ramp to
 *      the default cruise height, then joins the formation.
 *   5. After MISSION_DURATION_S, every drone lands independently and
 *      disarms.  A drone whose battery goes critical, fix is lost, or
 *      strays past the geofence lands early on its own — this does not
 *      affect the others.
