/*
 * main.c — change-partners choreo on a simulated Crazyflie (Webots),
 * the cf21bl substrate for the examples/webots-formation pattern
 *
 * Webots counterpart to examples/cf21bl-formation's Choreo mode: the exact
 * same generated choreo_script.h (from cf21bl-formation's own
 * change-partners.choreo.toml, via sdk/tools/choreoc.py) drives the same
 * L4/L6/L7 stack (world_model.c/bse.c/choreo.c) and the same L3 gossip
 * framing (gossip.c — see ../common/zephyr_shim/); none of those files
 * have any Webots- or POSIX-specific code in them, they are simply built
 * from this substrate's own Makefile instead of Zephyr's. Only L1 (this
 * file's flight-state machine + substrate_webots.c, both cf21bl-specific)
 * is new to this substrate; L3's transceiver
 * (../common/transceiver_udp_posix.c) is shared across every substrate in
 * this example — including, as of wire.h v5, a directive rx/tx path (see
 * that file) that mirrors this loop's remote-directive polling below. See
 * ../../README.md for the full architecture, the "Porting to a different
 * element" section for what a new substrate needs to write, and the
 * deliberate scope cuts noted inline below.
 *
 * One controller process per drone (Webots' standard multi-robot model,
 * same as one OS process per physical element on real hardware). Element
 * ID and swarm size come from Webots controllerArgs (see
 * ../../worlds/change_partners.wbt) rather than the radio auto-ID
 * negotiation cf21bl-formation uses — Webots starts every controller
 * deterministically together, so there is no discovery problem to solve.
 *
 * Usage (set by the .wbt file's controllerArgs, not run manually):
 *   cf21bl <element_id> <n_elements>
