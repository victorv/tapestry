/*
 * choreo_telemetry.h — per-tick L6/L7 CSV capture for offline replay
 *
 * Records, once per WM_CYCLE_MS tick, everything Choreo.tick() saw as
 * input (this element's own wm_entries snapshot, scr_state) and everything
 * it produced as output (script step, directive, achievement) — enough to
 * re-drive sdk/python/tapestry's Choreo engine against the exact same
 * inputs offline and diff its outputs against what really happened here.
 * This is capture infrastructure for the offline replay harness described
 * in ../../README.md and sdk/CHOREO_API.md's "Parity and regression
 * replay" section — not a general logging facility, and not ML training
 * (see tapestry/choreo.h's status banner for that distinction).
 *
 * Opt-in only: set TAPESTRY_TELEMETRY_DIR to a writable directory before
 * launching Webots to enable capture. Unset (the default), this is a
 * complete no-op — every call below degrades to nothing so normal demo
 * runs pay no cost and write no files.
 *
 * One CSV per element: <dir>/choreo_<element_id>.csv. Kept per-element
 * (rather than one shared file) because each element's replay is
 * self-contained — it only ever needs its own recorded rows, never another
 * element's file, so there's no cross-file join to get right at replay
 * time. See sdk/tools/choreo_sim.py (--replay mode) for the reader.
