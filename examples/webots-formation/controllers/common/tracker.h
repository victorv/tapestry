/*
 * tracker.h — choreo target tracker (world-frame meters)
 *
 * Trimmed from examples/cf21bl-formation/src/formation.h: keeps only
 * demo_choreo_track (Choreo-mode target leash + emergency repulsion) and
 * its supporting types. demo_compute_drive (the showcase-mode leaderless
 * spring field) isn't needed here — this example only runs Choreo mode —
 * so it and its only-used constants (SPRING_K, DEMO_ROT_OMEGA_RADPS,
 * DEMO_ALIGN_ROT_RADPS, DEMO_ANCHOR_*, DEMO_SOLO_GLIDE_MPS) are dropped.
 *
 * demo_choreo_track itself is unmodified logic — same target-leash,
 * emergency-repulsion, and arena-clamp behavior already flight-validated
 * on cf21bl hardware. The one change is DEMO_ARENA_LIMIT_M: hardware
 * derives it from CONFIG_CF21BL_POS_MAX_M (a Zephyr Kconfig value); here
 * it's a plain constant sized for a Webots arena instead.
 *
 * Units: meters, world frame — matches Webots GPS output directly (no
 * "home" concept to convert through, unlike the lighthouse-relative
 * hardware version).
