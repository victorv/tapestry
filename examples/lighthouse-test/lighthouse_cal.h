/*
 * lighthouse_cal.h — the ONE in-code copy of the base-station
 * geometry + OOTX calibration, generated from lighthouse_cal.yaml
 * (same directory; cfclient export, 2026-07-06 second recalibration — BS1
 * suspected partially occluded, tilted further and re-run).
 *
 * Every executable that consumes lighthouse position includes THIS file —
 * the constants used to be duplicated per-example, and a partial update
 * (2 of 4 copies) once shipped stale geometry to a flight.  If the room is
 * recalibrated: re-run cfclient's Estimate Geometry, export the YAML, and
 * update this ONE file (poses from "geos:", calib from "calibs:").
 *
 * - Poses ("geos:") change whenever a base station is MOVED or TILTED.
 * - OOTX sweep calibration ("calibs:") is factory data tied to each
 *   physical base station's uid — it does NOT change with placement, only
 *   if a base station unit is swapped.
 * - The world frame is defined by the drone's pose during Estimate
 *   Geometry.  All drones in a formation MUST fly the same values —
 *   gossiped positions are only comparable in a shared frame.
 *
 * Sanity check after any recalibration (see examples/lighthouse-test):
 * a drone on the floor at the calibration spot must read ≈ (0, 0, 0).
