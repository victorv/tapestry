/*
 * main.c — Tapestry Demo: Collective Formation (Cutebot ground rover)
 *
 * Two build modes (Kconfig choice DEMO_MODE, see Kconfig):
 *
 *   DEMO_MODE_CHOREO (default) — the L5/L6/L7 path. ONE BINARY for all
 *     robots: element IDs are negotiated at boot (transport_negotiate_id,
 *     unchanged from the original design). A real L5 SCR (scr_init()/
 *     scr_tick() below) drives quorum from the actual world model — this
 *     app previously had ZERO L5, not even a synthetic-quorum stand-in.
 *     A declarative L7 Choreo script (../form-grid.choreo.toml) drives the
 *     robots through the L6 BSE:
 *       1. hold — station-keep at the boot-time position (coordinate-free)
 *       2. form (shape=grid) — arrange into a near-square grid centered on
 *          the arena, via demo_track_target()'s differential-drive
 *          go-to-point controller (formation.c) — the FIRST real-hardware
 *          consumer of Choreo's FORM goal anywhere in this repo (every
 *          other example either doesn't use it or only exercises it in
 *          host-side unit tests)
 *       3. hold — settle on the finished grid
 *     Script completion → directive IDLE → quiescence: this platform maps
 *     it to simply holding still (no takeoff/landing concept for a ground
 *     rover, unlike cf21bl-formation).
 *
 *   DEMO_MODE_SHOWCASE — the original, hardware-validated L4-only spring
 *     field (demo_compute_drive(), unchanged): pure emergent behavior, no
 *     SCR/L6/L7. Kept as a fallback — see Kconfig's help text.
 *
 * DEMO_MODE_CHOREO ran end-to-end on four physical robots on 2026-08-24
 * (hold -> form(grid) -> hold, BLE gossip, real L5 quorum); approach speed
 * is untuned.  The tests/ suite covers the same path host-side.  The
 * boot/negotiation/sync-hold path and DEMO_MODE_SHOWCASE are unchanged
 * from the hardware-validated original — only the choice of what drives
 * speed_cmd/rate_cmd in the main loop is new. See the README's "Known
 * limitations" for the FORM/abs_position caveat (dead-reckoning drift).
 *
 * ID assignment is handled by transport_negotiate_id() — see transport.h and
 * CONFIG_TAPESTRY_AUTO_ID_WINDOW_MS for the auto-ID protocol details.
 *
 * See formation.h for physical calibration constants.

 * Seed each robot near the arena center on a tiny 3-unit circle, and
 * return the outward-facing heading angle.
 *
 * The 3-unit radius keeps all robots visually clustered at start while
 * placing adjacent robots ~4 units apart — far below DEMO_TARGET_SPACING —
 * so spring repulsion immediately drives them outward.
 *
 * The heading is set to the outward angle so every robot's spring force
 * projects fully forward on tick 1.  Without this, robots whose force
 * points opposite to heading 0 drive backward and collide with neighbors.
 * DEMO_MODE_CHOREO's FORM step doesn't need this property (demo_track_
 * target's go-to-point law works from any starting heading), but the
 * shared boot/sync-hold path runs before Choreo is submitted, so both
 * modes still benefit from a non-degenerate start.
 *
 * Physical placement: orient each robot so its physical forward direction
 * matches its assigned heading (see README for per-ID compass directions).
