/*
 * bse.c — Tapestry L6 Behavior Synthesis Engine
 *
 * See bse.h for the full interface contract and v1.0 feature scope (what's
 * open-core here vs. deliberately licensed-tier).
 *
 * All positions are real 3D (x, y, z) throughout — see position_t (csm.h).
 * Achievement and DISPERSE's spacing check are true 3D Euclidean distance.
 * FORM's shapes (CIRCLE/LINE/GRID) and SPIN stay planar by definition of
 * what those named patterns are, positioned at a real z; EXCHANGE reassigns
 * x/y stations only — z is deliberately NOT exchanged, staying fixed at
 * this element's own current altitude for the whole maneuver (see
 * exchange_capture()'s comment for why: walking two elements through each
 * other's altitude mid-swap would erode vertical separation exactly when
 * horizontal separation is also smallest). None of this is optional or
 * "z ignored if unset" — every goal always considers the real z it's given.
 *
 * What this implements:
 *   - Intent parsing: reads the active intent type.
 *   - Task decomposition (FORM): maps the FORM goal to per-element vertex
 *     assignments, N = active fresh element count, using intent.shape:
 *     CIRCLE (regular N-gon), LINE (evenly spaced on the X axis), or GRID
 *     (near-square rows/cols, radius as cell spacing) — all centered on
 *     intent.target.  Each element independently derives its own vertex
 *     from its peer-rank ordinal; no coordination messages needed.
 *   - Task decomposition (EXCHANGE): rotate stations by slot_shift around
 *     the ID-sorted participant ring, over a SNAPSHOT of positions captured
 *     at activation; the commanded target travels a CCW arc about the
 *     snapshot centroid so mutual separation is preserved by construction.
 *   - HOLD: captures own position at activation and station-keeps there,
 *     UNLESS the intent it replaces just achieved a MOVE_TO_POINT goal —
 *     then it inherits that goal point instead (see bse_submit_intent()'s
 *     snapshot_prev_goal() and the HOLD case in bse_tick()), avoiding the
 *     achieve_eps slop and tracker overshoot a live-position capture would
 *     otherwise bake in as a permanent station offset.
 *   - Feedback controller (minimal): achievement predicate — own position
 *     within achieve_eps of the goal point for achieve_hold_ms, for every
 *     goal type except DISPERSE, which has no single goal point (see below).
 *   - For MOVE: offset-preserving translation — the
 *     formation's shape is preserved while its centroid travels to
 *     intent.target (own offset from the participant centroid is snapshot
 *     at activation).  A solo element has zero offset, so MOVE degenerates
 *     to CONVERGE — correct, there is nothing to preserve.
 *   - For CONVERGE: emits MOVE_TO_POINT to intent.target for all elements
 *     (deliberately collapses the formation — this is the "gather" goal).
 *   - For DISPERSE: emits MAINTAIN_SPRING with intent.radius as spacing.
 *     Achievement predicate is nearest-fresh-trusted-peer 3D distance >=
 *     spacing - achieve_eps, sustained for achieve_hold_ms; vacuously
 *     achieved with no peer visible. Safety-relevant 3D spacing math, not
 *     yet flight-validated — see the README caveat this mirrors.
 *   - For IDLE / unknown: emits IDLE.
 *
 * What this does NOT do:
 *   - Optimization across swarm (physics-aware planning, ML inference) —
 *     the EXCHANGE arc is a fixed geometric deconfliction rule, not a
 *     planner.  Licensed-tier scope, not a gap to fill here.
 *   - Path planning or obstacle avoidance.
 *   - Collective achievement aggregation: bse_goal_achieved() is own-goal
 *     only by design — the scope=all aggregation across peers is L7's
 *     job (choreo_collective_achieved() in choreo.c), one layer up.
