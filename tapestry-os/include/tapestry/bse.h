/* ── Intent: L7 → L6 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────── */
/*
 * IDLE / FORM / DISPERSE / CONVERGE reference absolute coordinates supplied
 * by the application.  HOLD and EXCHANGE instead reference the collective's
 * OWN current configuration (positions read from the L4 world model) — no
 * coordinates appear in the intent at all.  MOVE is a hybrid: an absolute
 * target, displaced per-element by an offset read from the collective's own
 * configuration at activation (see below) — the formation translates as a
 * rigid body instead of collapsing onto the target.
 *
 *   HOLD      Stay at the current station.  On the first tick, IF the
 *             intent it replaces was an ACHIEVED MOVE_TO_POINT goal
 *             (EXCHANGE/FORM/MOVE/CONVERGE all produce one), the element
 *             inherits THAT goal point as its station instead of its live
 *             position — "hold the station you were sent to," not "hold
 *             wherever you coasted to."  Achievement only guarantees
 *             being within achieve_eps, and a body decelerating from a
 *             traverse routinely overshoots past that already-loose
 *             tolerance before settling (flight 22: 0.19 m past an
 *             EXCHANGE station, off a table edge).  Otherwise (no prior
 *             achieved goal — e.g. HOLD is the very first goal, or the
 *             prior step ended on a timeout instead of achievement) the
 *             element captures its own live position as before.  Either
 *             way, once captured, station-keeps there (directive
 *             MOVE_TO_POINT to the captured point).
 *
 *   MOVE      Translate the formation to intent.target, preserving shape.
 *             On activation each element snapshots its own offset from the
 *             participant centroid (self + fresh peers); every tick the
 *             commanded point is intent.target + that offset, so the
 *             formation's relative geometry travels as a rigid body instead
 *             of every element collapsing onto the same point (that
 *             collapse is what CONVERGE does instead).  A solo element has
 *             a zero offset, so MOVE degenerates to CONVERGE for it —
 *             correct, there is no formation to preserve.
 *
 *   EXCHANGE  Rotate stations by slot_shift around the ID-sorted ring of
 *             participants (self + fresh peers): element at rank r takes the
 *             station of the element at rank (r + slot_shift) mod N.  With
 *             two elements and slot_shift=1 this is exactly "swap places".
 *
 *             Stations are a SNAPSHOT of participant positions captured from
 *             the world model at intent activation — frozen, never
 *             live-chasing (two elements each flying at the other's live
 *             position never converge).  If no fresh peer is visible at
 *             activation the capture retries each tick and the directive is
 *             HOLD until it succeeds.
 *
 *             The commanded target travels an ARC about the snapshot
 *             centroid (constant angular rate, radius interpolated), all
 *             elements orbiting in the same (CCW) direction — so mutual
 *             separation is preserved by construction instead of every
 *             element cutting straight through the formation center.  This
 *             is the minimal stand-in for the physics-aware planner: pure
 *             geometry, identical on every element, no messages.
