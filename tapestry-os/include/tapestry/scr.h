/*
 * tapestry/scr.h — Tapestry Swarm Coordination Runtime (L5) public API
 *
 * Includes <tapestry/csm.h> (L4), so including this header gives access
 * to the complete L4–L5 public surface.
 *
 * The SCR sits above the CSM and provides collective services:
 *
 *   Quorum management — tracks whether the swarm has enough reachable,
 *     fresh peers to operate with confidence.  Three levels: HEALTHY,
 *     DEGRADED, and LOST, parameterised by quorum_min and quorum_target
 *     (both expressed as peer counts, not fractions).
 *
 *   Role election — deterministic, message-free leader election.  The
 *     fresh peer with the lowest element_id is elected leader.  Every
 *     element computes this independently from its current world model
 *     snapshot; no additional messaging is required.  Convergence time
 *     is bounded by WM_STALE_THRESHOLD_MS (1500 ms).
 *
 *   Extended roles — non-leaders self-assign a functional role from
 *     their capability flags (relay, sensor, actuator).  All peers
 *     independently compute the same leader; each follower independently
 *     derives its own extended role.  Message-free invariant is preserved.
 *
 *   Task slot — each element's ordinal index in the sorted fresh peer
 *     list (0 = leader).  Gives L6 BSE a deterministic, collision-free
 *     vertex-assignment index without L5 performing task decomposition.
 *
 *   Abort protocol — detects quorum-loss and quorum-recovery transitions
 *     as one-tick signals (SCR_ABORT_TRIGGERED / SCR_ABORT_CLEARED) that
 *     L6 can consume each cycle without polling quorum state history.
 *
 *   Lightweight BFT — peer whitelist (deployment-time trust restriction)
 *     and anomaly exclusion (reactive fault detection) mitigate the most
 *     common Byzantine vector (rogue ID injection) for closed deployments.
 *     Full PBFT consensus is not implemented; this is a best-effort
 *     mitigation, not a formal BFT guarantee.
 *
 * Design invariant (shared with L4):
 *   No OS-specific types, no dynamic allocation.  Pure C99.
 *   Compiles cleanly against any C99 toolchain with libm.
 *   Peer IDs must be in [0, 31]; BFT masks are uint32_t (MAX_ELEMENTS = 32).

/*
 * scr_set_quorum_hold_ms — Require a LOST -> >=DEGRADED recovery to be
 * SUSTAINED for hold_ms before scr_tick() reports it, instead of reporting
 * the very first tick a peer looks fresh again.
 *
 * Rationale: a single lucky gossip frame keeps a peer entry "fresh" for
 * WM_STALE_THRESHOLD_MS even under otherwise-poor link quality, so gating
 * quorum recovery on instantaneous freshness can flicker quorum_state (and
 * therefore SCR_ABORT_CLEARED) up for one tick on a single packet — not
 * real, sustained contact. Requiring hold_ms of continuous >=DEGRADED
 * classification before reporting recovery filters that out; a genuine
 * partition heal is unaffected once the network is actually reconnected
 * for that long.
 *
 * Scope — deliberately narrow, matching the flight-tested behavior this
 * generalizes (see CHANGELOG for the app-level filter this replaced):
 *   - Only the recovery edge (LOST -> >=DEGRADED) is held. Quorum LOSS is
 *     always immediate and unaffected by this setting — SCR_ABORT_TRIGGERED
 *     still fires on the very tick quorum drops.
 *   - Fluctuation entirely within the recovered zone (DEGRADED <-> HEALTHY,
 *     never touching LOST) is never held — quorum_state tracks it live.
 *   - While a recovery is held, scr_get_quorum() reports SCR_QUORUM_LOST
 *     (not the true, better instantaneous classification) and
 *     scr_get_abort_state() stays at whatever it already was — this is the
 *     whole point: L6/L7 must see a single, self-consistent view, so
 *     nothing downstream of scr_tick() (role, leader, task_slot,
 *     SCR_ABORT_CLEARED — everything Step 4 onward computes) ever observes
 *     a "recovered but still LOST" state that the L5 contract says cannot
 *     happen. SCR_ABORT_CLEARED is delayed by hold_ms as a direct
 *     consequence — this is intentional, not a side effect to work around.
 *   - The recovery timer resets to 0 immediately if quorum drops back to
 *     LOST before hold_ms elapses (no partial credit toward the next
 *     recovery attempt).
 *
 * Cold-boot acquisition is held too, not just recovery from a real prior
 * partition: scr_init() starts quorum_state at SCR_QUORUM_LOST, so the
 * very first tick(s) after boot look identical to "recovering from LOST"
 * to the logic above, and are held for the same hold_ms. This is
 * intentional and faithful to the app-level filter this generalizes
 * (its own hold counter also started at 0 on boot) — call
 * scr_set_quorum_hold_ms() once, right after scr_init(), and expect
 * every element's very first quorum acquisition to take at least
 * hold_ms, not just its recovery from a later partition.
 *
 * hold_ms=0 (scr_init()'s default) disables this entirely: quorum_state
 * tracks the instantaneous classification on every tick, exactly as before
 * this feature existed. Assumes scr_tick() is called once per WM_CYCLE_MS,
 * the same cadence every other per-cycle debounce in this codebase (BSE's
 * anchor hold, Choreo's membership hold) already assumes.
